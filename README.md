# ConnectFour
 A two-player game where  you have to connect 4  tokens in horizontal,  vertical, and diagonal  patterns to win the game!
 Developing a Connect Four game in Java helps in learning the language by reinforcing object-oriented programming principles, understanding data structures and algorithms through managing a 2D game board, and practicing event-driven programming for GUI development. It enhances logical thinking, debugging skills, and provides practical application of software development concepts.
